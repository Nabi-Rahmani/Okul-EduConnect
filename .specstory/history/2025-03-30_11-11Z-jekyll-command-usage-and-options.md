# Jekyll Commands

Here are the most common Jekyll commands:

```bash
# Install Jekyll
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-site

# Build site
jekyll build

# Serve locally (with live reload)
jekyll serve

# Serve with drafts enabled
jekyll serve --drafts

# Build with specific configuration
jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml

# Clean the site (removes generated files)
jekyll clean
```

You can run these in your terminal. For more options, use `jekyll help` or `jekyll help COMMAND`.

# Jekyll Commands for Running a Site

Here are the commands specifically for running a Jekyll site:

```bash
# Basic serve (http://localhost:4000)
jekyll serve

# With Bundler (recommended)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Auto-refresh browser when files change
jekyll serve --livereload

# Include draft posts
jekyll serve --drafts

# Only rebuild changed files (faster)
jekyll serve --incremental

# Change port number
jekyll serve --port 4001

# Make accessible from local network
jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0

# Set environment to production
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll serve

# Stop the server
Ctrl+C
```

Most modern Jekyll projects use Bundler, so `bundle exec jekyll serve` is typically recommended.

for the first time what i need to install jecklley project

---

_**Assistant**_

# Setting Up a Jekyll Project for the First Time

Here's what you need to install and set up a Jekyll project from scratch:

## 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Ruby (if not already installed)
# On macOS:
brew install ruby

# Make sure Ruby is in your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## 2. Create a New Jekyll Site

```bash
# Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-site-name

# Navigate to your new site
cd my-site-name
```

## 3. Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies in your project
bundle install

# Start the Jekyll server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Your site should now be running at `http://localhost:4000`

If you're using an existing Jekyll theme or repository, you would clone it instead of creating a new site, then run `bundle install` followed by `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

---

_**Assistant**_

To push your commits to the master branch, you should use the following command:

```bash
git push origin master
```

Where:
- `origin` is the name of the remote repository (usually the default)
- `master` is the branch name you want to push to

If you're pushing for the first time, or if you're not sure what remotes you have configured, you can check your remotes with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This will show you all configured remote repositories and their URLs.

If you need to add a remote, you can use:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Nabi-Rahmani/Okul-EduConnect.git
```

Then try pushing again with `git push origin master`.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `_config.yml` file to remove the presskit_download_link entry:

```yaml
#page title
page_title                                :                                           # Automatically populates with app name if not set and if iOS app ID is set. Otherwise enter manually.

```

I've removed the `presskit_download_link` entry from the configuration file. If there are any other "what is new" related items you want to remove, please let me know which specific entries those are.

remove what is new and press kit tobbar

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove the presskit_download_link and make sure the topbar configuration is clean:

```yaml
#page title
page_title                                :                                           # Automatically populates with app name if not set and if iOS app ID is set. Otherwise enter manually.

# App Info

ios_app_country                           : us                                        # Required outside USA. Enter 2 letter country code as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

appstore_link                             : https://apps.apple.com/app/id1234793120

app_name                                  :  Okul                                     # Automatically populates if not set and if iOS app ID is set.  Otherwise enter manually.
app_price                                 :                                           # Automatically populates if not set and if iOS app ID is set.  Otherwise enter manually.

# ...existing code...

# Theme Settings
topbar_color                              : "#d53953"
topbar_transparency                       : 0.1
topbar_title_color                        : "#ffffff"
```

I've removed the `presskit_download_link` entry which would typically add a press kit link to your site. 

For the "what is new" element - there isn't a specific configuration parameter with that name in the file. If it's appearing in your topbar, it might be part of the Jekyll theme you're using. To completely remove or modify elements in the topbar, you might need to edit the theme's template files (typically in the `` or `` directory).

mastodon_link                             : https://mastodon.social/@ebaehr add my email 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me update the mastodon_link field with your email:

```yaml
// ...existing code...
facebook_username                         :                                           
instagram_username                        : ebaehr
twitter_username                          : ebaehr
github_username                           : https://github.com/Nabi-Rahmani
youtube_username                          :
mastodon_link                             : nabi007.dev@gmail.com
// ...existing code...
```

I've replaced the Mastodon link with your email address. Note that this field might be intended for a Mastodon social media profile link rather than an email address. If you want to remove it entirely instead, you could use:

```yaml
mastodon_link                             : 
```

Or if you want to use it differently, let me know!

_**User (2025-03-31 12:28Z)**_

twitter_username                          : @nabirahmani_dev why is error

---

_**Assistant**_

The error is happening because in YAML syntax, values starting with special characters like `@` should be quoted. The `@` symbol has special meaning in YAML, so it needs to be enclosed in quotes.

Here's the correct way to write it:

```yaml
twitter_username                          : "@nabirahmani_dev"
```

By adding quotes around the value, you're telling YAML to treat it as a literal string instead of trying to interpret the `@` symbol as a special character. This should resolve the error.

# Install dependencies in your project
bundle install

# Start the Jekyll server
bundle exec jekyll serve write agian

---

_**Assistant**_

# Install and Run Jekyll Project

To install dependencies and start your Jekyll server:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)
cd /Users/nabirahmani/Desktop/Flutter_Apps/Okul-EduConnect

# Install all dependencies defined in your Gemfile
bundle install

# Start the Jekyll server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will:
1. Install all required gems specified in your Gemfile
2. Build your site and serve it locally
3. By default, your site will be available at http://localhost:4000

Additional useful options:

```bash
# Serve with live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Serve and include draft posts
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts

# Serve on a different port
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001

# Serve and make accessible from other devices on your network
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

If you encounter any errors during installation or serving, they'll be displayed in the terminal to help you troubleshoot.

_**User (2025-03-31 12:40Z)**_

find me made by

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking through your `_config.yml` file, I don't see a specific "made by" field. The attribution information is likely coming from these fields:

```yaml
# Information About Yourself
your_name                                 : Nabi Rahmani
```

And possibly:

```yaml
github_username                           : Nabi-Rahmani
```

If you're looking for where the "Made by" text appears on your site, it's probably rendered by the Jekyll theme templates (likely in the `` or `` directories). The templates would use these values from your config file.

If you want to change how your name appears or remove the attribution, you would need to:
1. Check your theme's files for where this text is defined
2. Either modify those files or 
3. Override them by creating identical files in your project with your modifications

Would you like me to help you look for these template files to modify the "made by" text?

_**User (2025-03-31 12:59Z)**_

still show app store icon

---

_**Assistant**_

To remove the App Store icon that's still showing on your site, you need to modify your App Store related configuration. These settings in your `_config.yml` file are causing the App Store icon to display:

```yaml
# App Info
ios_app_id                                : 1234793120                                # Required. Enter iOS app ID to automatically populate name, price and icons (e.g. 718043190).
ios_app_country                           : us                                        # Required outside USA. Enter 2 letter country code as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

appstore_link                             : https://apps.apple.com/app/id1234793120
```

To remove the App Store icon, change these lines to:

```yaml
# App Info
ios_app_id                                :                                          # Required. Enter iOS app ID to automatically populate name, price and icons (e.g. 718043190).
ios_app_country                           :                                          # Required outside USA. Enter 2 letter country code as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

appstore_link                             : 
```

By clearing these values, the theme should no longer display the App Store icon. After making these changes, rebuild your site with `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see the changes.

_**User (2025-03-31 13:01Z)**_

no still header icon is show app store icon

---

_**Assistant**_

The header icon showing in your site comes from this line in `header.html`:

```html
<img class="headerIcon" src="{{ site.app_icon | relative_url }}" alt="appicon">
```

It's displaying the image specified by `app_icon` in your config file. To remove the App Store icon from the header, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Modify the `header.html` file

```html
<div class="logo">
    <div class="appIconShadow">
        <svg width="0" height="0">
            <defs>
                <clipPath id="shape">
                    <!-- ... existing SVG path ... -->
                </clipPath>
            </defs>
        </svg>
        <!-- Removed the app icon image -->
        <div class="divider"></div>
    </div>
    <p class="headerName">{{ site.app_name }}</p>
</div>
```

## Option 2: Clear the app_icon in `_config.yml`

```yaml
app_icon                                  :                      # Left this empty to remove icon
```

## Option 3: Replace with a different image

Create a different image (like your own logo) and replace the file at `appicon.png`.

After making any of these changes, rebuild your site with `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see the changes.

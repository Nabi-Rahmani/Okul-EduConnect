We collect both personal and non-personal information when you use the App. The types of data collected include:

- **Device Information**: We collect information about the device you are using, including the device type, operating system version, and IP address. This information is used for analytics, troubleshooting, and crash reporting.
- **Crash Reports**: We may collect error logs and diagnostic data through third-party services (such as Firebase Crashlytics) to identify and fix bugs or technical issues.

### b. User-Provided Data:
- **Search History**: Words that you look up within the app are stored locally on your device, unless they are synced to an account you create with us.
- **Account Data**: If you create an account to use additional features, we may collect your email address and password for account management and security purposes.

### c. Third-Party Services:
- **Analytics**: We use third-party analytics services such as [Google Analytics/Firebase Analytics] to monitor and analyze the usage of the App. These services may collect anonymized data related to how you interact with the App. You can review their privacy policies at Google Analytics Privacy Policy and Firebase Privacy Policy.
- **Advertising**: If advertisements are displayed in the App, we use third-party advertising providers such as [AdMob/Facebook Ads] that may collect advertising identifiers for targeted advertising. For more information, refer to their privacy policies: AdMob Privacy Policy and Facebook Ads Privacy Policy.
